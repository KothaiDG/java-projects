# Java Projects

This repository contains a few simple Java programs that I created while learning the language using **Eclipse IDE**.  
Each program helped me practice the basics of Java programming like input/output, loops, and conditional statements.

## 🧮 Calculator Program
This is a small calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations like **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**.  
It takes two numbers and an operator from the user, then displays the result.

## 🎓 Student Grade Calculator
This program calculates a student's **total marks, average percentage, and grade** based on the number of subjects.  
It helped me understand how to use **loops**, **if-else conditions**, and **user input validation** in Java.

**Example Output:**
===== Student Grade Calculator =====
Enter the number of subjects: 3
Enter marks obtained in subject 1 (out of 100): 85
Enter marks obtained in subject 2 (out of 100): 90
Enter marks obtained in subject 3 (out of 100): 78

===== Result =====
Total Marks: 253.0
Average Percentage: 84.33%
Grade: A

**Concepts Used:**  
`Scanner`, `for` loop, `if-else` conditions, arithmetic operations.

## 🎯 3. Number Guessing Game
A fun game where the computer randomly picks a number between **1 and 100**, and the user has to guess it.  
The program gives hints like *“Too High”* or *“Too Low”* until the correct number is guessed.

**Example Output:**
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Try to guess it!

Enter your guess: 45
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 78
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 65
🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts
**Concepts Used:**  
`Random` class, `while` loop, conditional statements.
