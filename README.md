# Java Calculator Project

## Overview
This is a small calculator program that I created using Java in Eclipse IDE.  
It can do basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
The user gives two numbers and an operator, and the program shows the result.

This project is done as a part of my Government Internship registration and to show my basic Java knowledge.
