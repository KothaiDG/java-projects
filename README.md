# Java Projects

This repository contains a few simple Java programs that I created while learning the language using **Eclipse IDE**.  
Each program helped me practice the basics of Java programming like input/output, loops, and conditional statements.

## 🧮 Calculator Program
This is a small calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations like **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**.  
It takes two numbers and an operator from the user, then displays the result.

## 🎓 Student Grade Calculator
This program calculates a student's **total marks, average percentage, and grade** based on the number of subjects.  
It helped me understand how to use **loops**, **if-else conditions**, and **user input validation** in Java.

**Example Output:**
===== Student Grade Calculator =====
Enter the number of subjects: 3
Enter marks obtained in subject 1 (out of 100): 85
Enter marks obtained in subject 2 (out of 100): 90
Enter marks obtained in subject 3 (out of 100): 78

===== Result =====
Total Marks: 253.0
Average Percentage: 84.33%
Grade: A
